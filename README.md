# sepsis
This is an online sepsis detection application based on machine learning algorithm consisting of admin's portal, sub-admin's portal, doctor's portal and an user's portal. Based on attribute details of a patient and the past clinical data, the system will determine whether the patient has sepsis or not.

Moreover, a report is generated which highlights the parameters based on which SOFA score is generated. SOFA score determines the level of sepsis.
